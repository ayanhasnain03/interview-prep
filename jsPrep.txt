Q: What are Client-side and Server-side?

A client is a device, application, or software component that requests and consumes services or resources from a server. 📱💻
A server is a device, computer, or software application that provides services, resources, or functions to clients. 🖥️🗄️



Q: What are Variables? What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?

Variables are used to store data. 📊

// var num=2;

`var` creates function-scoped variables. 🏠
`let` creates block-scoped variables. 📦
`const` can be assigned only once, and its value cannot be changed afterward. 🔒


Q: What are some important string operations in JavaScript?

String operations in JavaScript include:

Concatenation: Combining strings using + or concat(). ➕

Length: Getting the length of a string using .length. 📏

Indexing: Accessing characters using bracket notation, e.g., str[0]. 🔢

Substring: Extracting parts of a string using substring(), substr(), or slice(). ✂️

Search: Finding substrings with indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), includes(), startsWith(), and endsWith(). 🔍

Replace: Replacing parts of a string using replace() or replaceAll(). 🔄

Case Conversion: Changing case with toUpperCase() and toLowerCase(). 🔠🔡

Trim: Removing whitespace with trim(), trimStart(), and trimEnd(). ✂️

Split: Splitting a string into an array with split(). 🍴

Q-What is DOM? What is difference between HTMLcand DOM?

==> The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the web page as a tree-like structure that allows JavaScript to dynamically access and manipulate the content and structure of web page

 JAVASCRIPT-LOOPS 
 -----> 
 1.For loop
 2.While loop
 3.do-while loop
 4.for...of loop
 5.for...in loop


 Q- What are functions in JS? What are the types of functions?

 =>A function is a reuseable block of code that performs a specific task.



 => TYpes of function
 1.Named functions
 2.Anonymous function
 3.Function Expression
 4.Arrow Function
 5.IIFE
 6.Callback Function
 7.Higher order function



 Q-What are Arrow Functions in Js? What is it use?

 => Arrow function also known as fat arrow functions is a simpler and shorter way for defining functions in JavaScript.


 Q- What are Array is Js? How to get,add & remove elements from arrays?

 => An array is a data that allows yo to store multiple values in a single variable.


 Q- What are Objects in JavaScript?


 =>An Object is data type that allows you to store key-value pairs

 let object1 = {
    name:"Ayan",
    favColor:["red","white","green"]
 }
 console.log(object1.name) //output->Ayan



 Q- What is Scope in JavaScript?

==> Scope determine where variables are defined and where they can be accessed

 1. Global Scope -> accessible anywhere

 2.Function -> accessible inside function only

 3.Block Scope->accessible inside block




 Q- What is Hoisting in Js?

==> Hoisting is a JavaScript behaviour where Functions and variable declearations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase


//Function hoisting
myFunc()
function myFunc(){
    console.log("HEllo World)
}
//output:Hello



Q- What is Errorhandling in Js?



//try block contains the code that might throw an error
try{

}
//catch block is where the error is handeld
catch(error){

}


Q- What is Asynchronous programming in Js?


==> Asynchronous programming allows multiple tasks or operations to be initialised and excuted concurrently.

==> Asynchronous operations do not block the execution of the code

Variables And Datatypes

Q- What is the primitive or non-primitive data type in JS?

=> primitive -

*primitive DataType can holdonly single value;
*primitive DataType are immutable meaning they cannot be changed

Eg- Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Null, Undefined, Symbols

=> non-primitive-
non-primitive DataType can hold multiple values
they are mutable and can be changed
Eg- Arrays, Objects, Functions, Dates, RegExps



Q- What is the difference between null and undefined?

=> undefined: When a variable is decleared but not assigned a value.

eg:
let undefinedVariable;

undefinedVariable = undefined;

console.log(undefinedVariable);

output: undefined;

=> undefined can be used when you dont have the value right now, but you will get it after 
some logic operation.



=> null: null variables are intentionally assigned the null value.

* Null can be used when you are sure you do not have any value for the particular variable.



Q- What Use Of typeOf Operator? What is it used for?

=> typeOf operator is used to find the type of a variable

=> Real application use > typeOf operator can be used to validate the data received from external sources(api)


let num =42;
let str = "hello World";
let bool = true;

console.log(typeof num); output: number
console.log(typeof str); output: string
console.log(typeof bool); output: boolean


Q- What Is Type Coercion in Js?

=> Type coercion is the automatic conversion of one data type to another during certain operations or Comparisons.


let str = "42";
let num = 42;
console.log(str + num); output: 4242

let bool = true
console.log(num + bool); output:43

Q- Use Of TypeCoercion In JS?
 --> TypeCoercion is used during string and number concatenation.

 -->Type coercion can be used while useing Comparison operators.

 Q- what is diffrent between uniary , binary and ternary operator?


 => Unary Eg- +, -, !, ~, ++, --
 => Binary Eg- +, -, *, /, %, **, <<, >>, &, |, ^, &&
 =>ternary Eg- ?:



 Q- Short-circuit evaluation in js?



==> Short-circuit evaluation stops the execution as soon as the result can be determined withought evaluating the remaining sub Expressions


 //Short circuit evaluation with logical AND


let result1 = false && someFunction();
console.log(result1); //false 

//Short-circuit evaluation with logical OR

let result2 = false || someFunction();
console.log(result2); //false

Q- What is operator preedence in js?


==> As per operator preedence,operators with Higher precedence are evaluated first.

==> Following BODMAS rule
let a=6;
let b=3;
let c = 2;

let resullt = a + b * c + (a-b);

console.log(result);



Q- When to use wich type of conditional statement in  real applications?

==> 1. If ... else: for complex,diffrent & multiline execution.

==> benefit: Cover all scenarios.

eg :
 const age = 25;
if(age > 18){
console.log("Adult");
}else if(age > 12){
console.log("Teenager");
}else{
console.log("Child");
}



2.Ternary operator: for single line execution.
const isUser = true;
- benefit : short one line syntax
eg:-
isUser ? console.log("User") : console.log("Guest");


3. Switch statement

==> switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.





const dayofWeek = "tuesday"
 switch(a){
    case:"Monday"
    console.log("Start");
    break;
    case:"tuesday"
    case:"Sunday"
    console.log("weekend");
    break;
    default
    console.log("default");
 }
 output: tuesday



 Q- what is difference between == and === in js?

*Loose equality (==) operator compares two values for equally after performing type coercion. 
==> loose equality
console.log(1 == "1"); //true





==> strict equality(===) operator compares two values for equality without performing type coercion.
console.log(1 === "1"); //false

Q- What is the differnce between spread and Rest operator in js?

==> Spread Operator Examples
const array =[1,2,3];

console.log(...array); //1,2,3


==> use of spread operator
1.Copying Array,
2. passing multiple Arguments to a function,
3. Merging Arrays



eg- copying array
const orriginalArray = [1, 2, 3];

const copiedArray = [...originalArray];

console.log(copiedArray); // [1, 2, 3]


eg: Merging arrays

const array1 = [1, 2, 3];

const array2 = [4, 5, 6];

const mergedArray = [...array1, ...array2];

console.log(mergedArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


eg:Passing multiple Arguments to a function
const number = [1,2, 3,4,5];

 sum = (...number) ;

function sum(a,b,c,d,e){
    console.log(a+b+c+d+e);
    //output:15
}



//Rest operator



==>The Rest operator is used in function parameters to collect the remaining arguments into an array.



display(1,2,3,4,5);

function display(first,second,...restArrguemnets) {
console.log(first);//1
console.log(second);//2
console.log(restArrguemnets);//[3,4,5]
}

Q- What is the indexOf() Method in Js?

=> indexOf() method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.

eg->
const array = [1,3,4,5,7,8];
let a = array.indexOf(8)
console.log(a) //position 5


Q- What is the difference between find() and fillter() and Slice() methods of an array in js?


FInd:- find() method get the first element that satisfies a given condition.

eg:-
const array = [1,3,4,5];
let c = array.find((num)=>{

    num % 2 === 0;

    console.log(c)//2
})



filter() Method ->

=> filter() method get an array of elements that satisfies a  condition.

const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

let d = array.filter((num) => {
    num % 2 === 0;
    console.log(d)//[2,4,6,8,10]
})




Slice Method:-
-> Slice method get a subset of the array from start index to  index (end not included)

const array = ["a", "b", "c", "d","e","f"];

let e = array.slice(2,5); // ["c", "d","e"]
console.log(e)




Q- What is the difference between push() and concat() methods in js?

=> push() will modify the original array itself

eg- 
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

array.push(6);//[1,2,3,4,5,6]


=> concat() will create the new array 
and not modify the original array

const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

array.concat(6,7);//[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]



Q- What is the difference between pop() and shift() methods in js?

=>pop() method removes the last element of the array.


const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

array.pop();

console.log(array);//[1,2,3,4]


==> shift() method removes the first element of the array.

const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

array.shift();

console.log(array);//[2,3,4,5]


Q- What is the splice method in js?

=> splice() method is used to add, remove,or replace elements in an array.
array.splice(start,deleteCount,...itemsToAdd)

let letters = ["a", "b", "c"];

//Add 'x' and 'y' at index 1

letters.splice(1,0,"x","y");//0 for delete
console.log(letters)//["a","x","y","b","c"]


//remove 1 element starting from index 1
let letterVar = ["a", "b", "c","d];

letterVar.splice(1,1)
console.log(letterVar)//["a","c","d"]


//replace at 2nd index

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry","lichi"];
fruits.splice(2, 1, "orange")//2 for index,1 for delete, "orange" for add
console.log(fruits)
