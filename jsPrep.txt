🚀 Understanding JavaScript and Its Engines 🚀

Q1: What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language used to convert static web pages into interactive and dynamic web pages! 🌟

Q2: What is the role of a JavaScript engine?
A JavaScript engine is a program present in web browsers that executes JavaScript code, making your web experience seamless and interactive.

Here’s a quick rundown of JavaScript engines across popular browsers:

Chrome: V8 Engine 🔥
Safari: Core JavaScript 🍏
Firefox: SpiderMonkey 🕷️
Edge: Chakra ⚡

Q: What are Client-side and Server-side?

A client is a device, application, or software component that requests and consumes services or resources from a server. 📱💻
A server is a device, computer, or software application that provides services, resources, or functions to clients. 🖥️🗄️



Q: What are Variables? What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?

Variables are used to store data. 📊

// var num=2;

`var` creates function-scoped variables. 🏠
`let` creates block-scoped variables. 📦
`const` can be assigned only once, and its value cannot be changed afterward. 🔒


Q: What are some important string operations in JavaScript?

String operations in JavaScript include:

Concatenation: Combining strings using + or concat(). ➕

Length: Getting the length of a string using .length. 📏

Indexing: Accessing characters using bracket notation, e.g., str[0]. 🔢

Substring: Extracting parts of a string using substring(), substr(), or slice(). ✂️

Search: Finding substrings with indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), includes(), startsWith(), and endsWith(). 🔍

Replace: Replacing parts of a string using replace() or replaceAll(). 🔄

Case Conversion: Changing case with toUpperCase() and toLowerCase(). 🔠🔡

Trim: Removing whitespace with trim(), trimStart(), and trimEnd(). ✂️

Split: Splitting a string into an array with split(). 🍴

Q-What is DOM? What is difference between HTMLcand DOM?

==> The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the web page as a tree-like structure that allows JavaScript to dynamically access and manipulate the content and structure of web page


Q- What are Selectors in JavaScript?

==> Dome Selector Method-
-getElementById()
-getElementByClassname()
-getElementByTagName()
querySelector()
querySelectorAll()


Q- what is DataType In Js?

*There are two types of Data-
=>primitive and Non primitive

//On primitive
1.Number 2.String 3.Booleans 4.Undefined 5.null

//On non-primitive
1.Object 2.Array 3.Function 4.Date 5.RegExp


Q-What Are operators ? What are the types of operators in js?
=> operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on operands


==> Type Of operators
1.Arithmetic Operators 2.Assignment Operators 3.Comparison Operators 4.Logical Operators 5.String Operators



1.ARITHEMETIC- `+` , `-` , `*` , `/` , `%`

2.ASSIGNMENT- `=` ,`+=` , `*=`

3.COMPARISON- `>` ,`<` , `>=` , `<=` , `===` , `!==`

4.Logical- `&&` ,`||` 

4.String Operators- `+`


Q-What are the Types of conditions statements in JS?

===> 1.if/else statement

if(1>5){ //false
console.log("true")
}else{
console.log("false")
}
===> 2.Ternary operators
let a = 1 > 5 ? "true" : "false"
===> 3.Switch statement
 let a =5
 switch(a){
    case:1
console.log("1");
break;
case:5:
console.log("2")
break;

default:
console.log("3")
 }
 //output-2

 Q-What is loop? What are the types of loops in JS?

 =>A loop is a programming way to run a piece of code repeatedly unit a certain condition is met.


 JAVASCRIPT-LOOPS 
 -----> 
 1.For loop
 2.While loop
 3.do-while loop
 4.for...of loop
 5.for...in loop


 Q- What are functions in JS? What are the types of functions?

 =>A function is a reuseable block of code that performs a specific task.



 => TYpes of function
 1.Named functions
 2.Anonymous function
 3.Function Expression
 4.Arrow Function
 5.IIFE
 6.Callback Function
 7.Higher order function



 Q-What are Arrow Functions in Js? What is it use?

 => Arrow function also known as fat arrow functions is a simpler and shorter way for defining functions in JavaScript.


 Q- What are Array is Js? How to get,add & remove elements from arrays?

 => An array is a data that allows yo to store multiple values in a single variable.


 Q- What are Objects in JavaScript?


 =>An Object is data type that allows you to store key-value pairs

 let object1 = {
    name:"Ayan",
    favColor:["red","white","green"]
 }
 console.log(object1.name) //output->Ayan



 Q- What is Scope in JavaScript?

==> Scope determine where variables are defined and where they can be accessed

 1. Global Scope -> accessible anywhere

 2.Function -> accessible inside function only

 3.Block Scope->accessible inside block




 Q- What is Hoisting in Js?

==> Hoisting is a JavaScript behaviour where Functions and variable declearations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase


//Function hoisting
myFunc()
function myFunc(){
    console.log("HEllo World)
}
//output:Hello



Q- What is Errorhandling in Js?



//try block contains the code that might throw an error
try{

}
//catch block is where the error is handeld
catch(error){

}


Q- What is Asynchronous programming in Js?


==> Asynchronous programming allows multiple tasks or operations to be initialised and excuted concurrently.

==> Asynchronous operations do not block the execution of the code

Variables And Datatypes

Q- What is the primitive or non-primitive data type in JS?

=> primitive -

*primitive DataType can holdonly single value;
*primitive DataType are immutable meaning they cannot be changed

Eg- Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Null, Undefined, Symbols

=> non-primitive-
non-primitive DataType can hold multiple values
they are mutable and can be changed
Eg- Arrays, Objects, Functions, Dates, RegExps



Q- What is the difference between null and undefined?

=> undefined: When a variable is decleared but not assigned a value.

eg:
let undefinedVariable;

undefinedVariable = undefined;

console.log(undefinedVariable);

output: undefined;

=> undefined can be used when you dont have the value right now, but you will get it after 
some logic operation.



=> null: null variables are intentionally assigned the null value.

* Null can be used when you are sure you do not have any value for the particular variable.



Q- What Use Of typeOf Operator? What is it used for?

=> typeOf operator is used to find the type of a variable

=> Real application use > typeOf operator can be used to validate the data received from external sources(api)


let num =42;
let str = "hello World";
let bool = true;

console.log(typeof num); output: number
console.log(typeof str); output: string
console.log(typeof bool); output: boolean


Q- What Is Type Coercion in Js?

=> Type coercion is the automatic conversion of one data type to another during certain operations or Comparisons.


let str = "42";
let num = 42;
console.log(str + num); output: 4242

let bool = true
console.log(num + bool); output:43

Q- Use Of TypeCoercion In JS?
 --> TypeCoercion is used during string and number concatenation.

 -->Type coercion can be used while useing Comparison operators.
